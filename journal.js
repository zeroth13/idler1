journal.pages.demo_quanta.contents =
'<p class="journal_text">The final unexplained component of the engine is the small black square above the memory column. This is the manipulator\'s internal storage, capable of holding one quantum. The glyph <span class="inline_code">swp</span> (without a number following the letters) swaps the quantum in the manipulator\'s storage (if any) with the quantum at the manipulator\'s current position (if any). This glyph can be used to have the manipulator \'pick up\' a quantum when it is not holding one in storage, or to drop a stored one in an empty spot.</p>'+
'<p class="journal_text">Observe that there are a few residual quanta on the engine\'s working surface. These are '+dict.drawQuantum('ember_faint',true)+' \'faint embers\', very weak quanta as the name suggests.

I will attempt to hook it up to my contemporary Catalytic Infuser stack, meager replacement as it may be."</p>'+
'<p class="journal_text">As you hopefully noticed, manipulating the quanta as instructed resulted in the creation of a new type of quantum, a '+dict.drawQuantum('ember_dim',true)+' \'dim ember\'. While the engine is used to manipulate and refine quanta in this manner, more mundane tools are needed to store and make use of the quanta in various ways. Open the Infuser panel.</p>'+
'<p class="journal_text">The Catalytic Infuser consists of \'stacks\' of items. You currently have access to a single stack containing a single item, an empty glass vial. Items can be moved to and from the infuser by dragging as usual.</p>';

journal.pages.demo_distil_2.contents =
'<p class="journal_text">The engine can send and receive quanta from the infuser\'s stacks. The <span class="inline_code">psh X</span> glyph pushes a quantum from the manipulator\'s internal storage to the storage on top of stack number X. The stack\'s number is noted on top of it, in this case 1. Once in this storage, items in the stack can receive the quantum. Items can only receive quanta from the storage or other items if there is nothing between the receiving item and donating item or storage. For example, if there is only the vial in the stack at any location, it can always receive the quantum pushed to the stack. However, if you place the vial in the second slot and a Glyphmatrix in the first slot, the vial is blocked from receiving the pushed quantum (and the Glyphmatrix is incapable of receiving it).</p>'+
'<p class="journal_text">The engine can not push a new quantum to a stack whose storage is currently occupied by a quantum. Further, glass vials can only contain one type of quantum at a time.</p>';

The engine tries to pull from the lowest possible item in the stack. If no item is present in the stack, it tries to pull from the stack\'s quantum storage on top. In this way an empty stack can effectively act as an extra single-quantum storage slot for the manipulator.</p>'+

Pressing it toggles the exposure of the engine\'s working surface to the surrounding Aether. In the full game, different locations would lead to different effects. In this demo, exposing the surface slowly accumulates '+dict.drawQuantum('ember_faint',true)+' faint embers onto the surface. Keeping the surface clear from quanta speeds up the accumulation of new quanta.</p>'+
'<p class="journal_text">Additionally, the <span class="inline_code">sur</span> glyph can be used to toggle the surface\'s exposure without using the switch, and the <span class="inline_code">stp</span> glyph can be used to turn off the engine.</p>'

The mould accepts 10 of the same type of quantum (it can not hold two types at once) and outputs a sheet of glass in the spot below itself. In the full game, different quanta would output different products.
